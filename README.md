# CAL
Creational Activity Lab (CAL)
The Creational Activity Lab (CAL) is an advanced-level programming lab designed to provide hands-on experience with modern Java Enterprise technologies. This lab focuses on equipping students with the skills required to build real-world, scalable, and maintainable Java applications using core backend technologies such as:
  -JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
  -Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
  -Spring Framework
  -Spring Boot
